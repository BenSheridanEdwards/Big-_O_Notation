# Big_O_Notation

Summary of what i've learnt about Big O Notation

## Theory

Big O Notation tells us how long our algorithm takes to run. It allows us to compare efficency in different algorithms that solve the same problem.

<i>With Big O notation, we're expressing the runtime in terms of how quickly it grows relative to the input, as the input gets arbitrarily large</i>

## Examples

### Constant Time, O(1)

### Linear Time, O(n)

### Quadratic Time, O(nÂ²)

## Caveats

### The input could be an array or integer, both in the examples below, run in constant time.
