# Big O Notation

Summary of what i've learnt about Big O Notation

## Theory

Big O Notation tells us how long our algorithm takes to run. It allows us to **compare efficency in different algorithms that solve the same problem**.

<i>With Big O notation, we're expressing the runtime in terms of <b>how quickly it grows relative to the input, as the input gets arbitrarily large</b></i>

### Implied Worst Case

When talking about algorithms with Big O Notation we think about the worst case scenario it could face. 

#### Needle in a haystack

Imagine you're trying to find a needle in an array haystack, in the best case you find the needle immediately at position 1 in the array, in which case the algorithm would be O(1), Constant time. The worst case however would be that you find the needle on the last position on the array, meaning you'd have to check every position on the array to find your needle, so in the worst case instead of O(1) constant time, it would be O(n) linear time. 

So we'd say the example below is O(n) linear time.

## Caveats

### The input could be an array or integer, both in the examples below, run in constant time.

- It's hard to pin down the exact runtime of an algorithm, it depends on variables such as the speed of the processer, what's already running on the computer etc. So instead of talking about runtime directly, **we use Big O Notation to express how quickly the runtime grows**.
