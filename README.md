# Big_O_Notation

Summary of what i've learnt about Big O Notation

## Theory

Big O Notation tells us how long our algorithm takes to run. It allows us to compare efficency in different algorithms that solve the same problem.

With Big O notation, we're expressing the runtime in terms of how quickly it grows relative to the input. 
This is done in the context that the input is arbitrarily large.
